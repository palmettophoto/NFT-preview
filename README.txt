## My process
This NFT preview example is built using html & css. I initially used a background image for the overlay using a seperate image with the overlay already applied and placing it in the background of the div. However I could not get it to display correctly on hover.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Utilizing absolute positioning I was able to produce the desired results with the overlay appearing on hover. Only after some time with trial & error however.

### Continued development

My focus will continue to be on gaining a more robust handle on CSS.

### Useful resources
